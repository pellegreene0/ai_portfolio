# A Real-Time Computer Vision Pipeline with Edge Deployment
## The Concept
This project is an end-to-end real-time object detection and tracking system, deployed across cloud and edge devices 
with continuous learning capabilities.

## Tech Stack
**Model**: Yolov8  
**Edge**: TBD  
**Cloud**: AWS SageMaker (Model Training)  
**Streaming**: Kafka and Redis (Real-Time Data Processing)  
**MLOps**: MLFlow (Experiment Tracking) and DVC(Data Versioning Control)  
**Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana (Model Performance Metrics)

## Features
- Real-time video processing at 30fps
- Model quantization and optimization for edge deployment
- Automated data drift detection and model retraining pipeline
- Federated Learning capabilities across edge nodes
- Performance benchmarking across different hardware configurations
